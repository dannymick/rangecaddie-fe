# RangeCaddie Frontend

RangeCaddie is a golf practice companion that helps players track shot performance, measure progress, and build data-driven practice sessions. The app provides structured practice modes, distance tracking, session summaries, and visual charts to make improvement more measurable and engaging. My goal is to turn it into a polished, subscription-based product aimed at golfers who want to train with purpose instead of guessing and aimlessly hitting golf balls at the driving range.
