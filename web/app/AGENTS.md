For the home screen the New range session card should really just be a call to action to start a new range session, not a form.

For the "New" tab, clicking on this should present the user with a conversational form to create a new range session. I imagine each form prompt should be a full screen modal with a progress bar at the top.

First, the user should be asked if they want to work on a specific aspect of their game, this can be a list of buttons. The options are:

- Short game (<150 yards)
- Long game (over 150 yards)
- Free range session (no specific aspect)
- Putting

My idea for the form is to track Pre Shot intention, Post Shot result, and then any notes. I think this is the most important information to track.

For the Pre shot intention in the Short game, Long game and Free range session modes, the form elements should appear in the following order:

- Club (should be a simple select menu)
- Target Distance (yards) (should be a simple select menu)
- Intended Flight (should be a simple select menu)
- Intended Dispersion (should be a simple select menu)

Once the user selects an option, the user should be asked if they want to work on a specific club, this can be a list of buttons. The options are:

- Driver
- Irons
- Wedges
- All clubs
