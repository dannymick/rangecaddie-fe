## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This repository contains the frontend portion of RangeCaddie. I’ve made this directory public so I can share examples of my React, TypeScript, component, and UI architecture with recruiters and hiring teams.

The backend code and API routes are intentionally excluded because they live in a private repo. I plan to release RangeCaddie as a commercial product, so the business logic, data models, and infrastructure remain private. Because of this, some requests in the app will return “failed to fetch” when run locally.

If you’d like more insight into specific parts of the frontend or architecture decisions, feel free to reach out.
